### Note: This project uses the old HPP (Hosted Payment Pages) integration of Adyen, which is not anymore supported.

# Adyengo

This is an Adyen app for Django. It provides an easy way to integrate the Adyen
payment system into a Django project. Regular, oneclick and recurring payments
are supported. All communication to and from Adyen is logged.

The project is however far from perfect and it hasn't been used in production
yet. There might be bugs, so be aware if you want to use this. Also, if you
use this app, you should still know how Adyen works, the app just simplifies
the process. However, occasionally the implementation documentation will
explain what happens under the hood. Sometimes it will refer to the Adyen
documentation for futher reading.


## Development

As said before, the project is far from perfect. Not all Adyen features are
implemented and the system hasn't even been tested thoroughly in production.
Since Adyen implementation is not straightforward and Adyen is a quite popular
payment service provider and Django is a popular framework, I hope people will
find use for it.

If you want to contribute, you're very welcome. Contact me for any questions.


## Installation

You can install Adyengo with pip:

    pip install adyengo


## Implementation

### Settings

To start out you should add some settings to Django's settings file (by default
in `myapp/settings.py`). All settings should be in a dict `ADYENGO`, for
example:

    ADYENGO = {
        'A_SETTING': 'A value',
        'ANOTHER_SETTING': 'Another value'
    }

#### Required settings

* `MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` - Your Adyen merchant account.
* `HMAC_KEY` - The HMAC key used to validate the communication with
  Adyen.
* `NOTIFICATION_HMAC_KEY` - The HMAC key used to validate notifications from
  Adyen.
* `MODE` - Use `test` to use the Adyen test environment or `live` to
  use the live environment. Default to `test`.

#### Required for Recurring Payments

* `API_USERNAME` - The username for the Adyen API.
* `API_PASSWORD` - The password for the Adyen API.

#### Optional settings

* `DEFAULT_SKIN_CODE` - The default skin code. Can always be overwritten.
* `DEFAULT_PAGE_TYPE` - The default page type for an Adyen HPP (Hosted Payment
  Pages) payment.
* `DEFAULT_CURRENCY_CODE` - The default currency code. Can always be
  overwritten.
* `DEFAULT_SHOPPER_LOCALE` - The default shopper locale. If it's not set, the
  system expects that the skin code will be provided when creating the session.
* `DEFAULT_RES_URL` - The default URL the user gets redirected to after an
  Adyen HPP (Hosted Payment Pages) payment.

### Usage

There are two ways to do a payment through Adyen. One is to forward the
customer to the **Adyen Hosted Payment Pages (HPP)** and the other is to do a
**Recurring Payment through Adyen's API**.

Adyengo reflects Adyen's interface in regular Django models and managers. The
main model to setup a payment is the `Session` model. So you create a payment
by creating an instance of the `Session` model.

#### The `Session` model

Most of the fields in the `Session` model reflect a field in the Adyen
interface. The only difference is that Adyen uses `camelCase` and Adyengo uses
`under_scores`. So a field in the Adyen interface like `merchantReference` will
become `merchant_reference` in Adyengo. We will refer to these fields as "Adyen
specific fields", other fields we'll call "Adyengo specific fields". When a
field in the `Session` model is an Adyen specific field it will be pointed out.
In this case you can get more information about the field in the Adyen
Integration Manual.

Besides the Adyen specific fields, the `Session` model has some Adyengo
specific fields for internal logic. The most important one is the
`session_type` field. This field decides what kind of payment the session
represents.

The choices for this field are defined in the `constants.py` which you can
import using `from adyengo import constants`. Then you can choose one of the
following:

* `constants.SESSION_TYPE_HPP_REGULAR` - For a regular payment.
* `constants.SESSION_TYPE_HPP_RECURRING` - To setup a recurring contract, or to
  do a "oneclick" recurring payment.
* `constants.SESSION_TYPE_API_RECURRING` - For a recurring payment.

Now let's set up a Regular payment so you get a feeling of how it works.

#### Regular Payment

##### Fields

To set up a regular payment, you should set the `session_type` field to
`constants.SESSION_TYPE_HPP_REGULAR` and provide the following Adyen specific
fields:

* `merchant_reference` - Unique id for the session.
* `payment_amount` - Amount for the payment in cents.

##### Optional fields

* `currency_code` - The currency code for the currency the amount is in.
  Choices are listed in the constants starting with `CURRENCY_CODE_`, for
  example `CURRENCY_CODE_EUR` for Euro. Only required if you didn't set
  `DEFAULT_CURRENCY_CODE`.
* `skin_code` - The skin code. If you set a default skin code using the
  `DEFAULT_SKIN_CODE` settings, you can exclude this field. If you provide it
  anyway, it will overwrite the default skin code.
* `ship_before_date` - The date the product should be shipped, provide as a
  Python date object. This defaults to 24 hours from now, which is a good
  default for online services. 
* `session_validity` - The date the session expires, provide as a Python date
  object.
* `shopper_reference` - Unique id for the customer.
* `shopper_email` - The customer's email address.

See the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/hpp-manual#hpppaymentfields)
for more information about the fields.

##### Adyengo fields

There's one Adyengo specific field you should provide, `page_type`. This field
decides to what kind of page the user gets forwarded. The choices are defined
in the constants:

* `constants.PAGE_TYPE_MULTIPLE` - For a multiple pages flow.
* `constants.PAGE_TYPE_SINGLE` - For a more modern single page app.
* `constants.PAGE_TYPE_SKIP` - To skip the page flow. For this choice,
    precicely one allowed payment method should be provided. We'll describe
    later how to do that.

##### Logging

When you've set up the `Session` model, you can `save()` it. This will
automatically turn into a log for you which you can consult in the Django
Admin.

##### Params

To forward the user to Adyen, you should have the session set up and put the
parameters in hidden form fields on the page you want to forward the user. You 
can then either have the user forward himself by clicking a submit button, or
automatically forward the user by submitting the form with JavaScript.

To get the parameters for the form, use the `params()` method on the `Session`
model. To get the url the form should post to, use the `url()` method.

##### Example

**view.py**

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.utils import timezone
    from adyengo.models import Session
    from adyengo import constants

    def forward_to_adyen(request):

        s = Session(
            session_type=constants.SESSION_TYPE_HPP_REGULAR,
            merchant_reference=51391,
            payment_amount=1000,
            currency_code=constants.CURRENCY_CODE_EUR,
            skin_code='Nl0r8s5C',
            session_validity=tomorrow,
            shopper_reference=13154,
            shopper_email='shopper@example.com',
            page_type=constants.PAGE_TYPE_MULTIPLE
        )
        s.save()

        url = s.url()
        params = s.params()

        return render(request, 'forward.html', {
            'url': url,
            'params': params
        })

**forward.html**

    <form id="adyengo-form" method="POST" action="{{ url }}">
        {% for var, value in params.items %}
            <input type="hidden" name="{{ var }}" value="{{ value }}" />
        {% endfor %}
    </form>

    <script>
        // automatically submit the form
        document.getElementById('adyengo-form').submit()
    </script>

This readme isn't finished yet. The code however is usable, so don't hesitate
to try it out, and update the readme!

### Adyengo Test pages

Adyengo has some test pages, which makes it easy to test different
kind of requests to Adyen. You can enable them by adding them to your main
`urls.py`:

    from django.conf import settings
    import adyengo

    urlpatterns = [
        # Here your regular urlpatterns
    ]

    if settings.DEBUG:
        urlpatterns += [
            url(r'^adyengo-test/', include(adyengo.site.urls))
        ]
